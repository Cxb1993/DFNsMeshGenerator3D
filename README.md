# DFNsMeshGenerator3D

DFNsMehGenerator3D: The executable version of the algorithm for adptively meshing highly discrete fracture networks into triangles or tetrahedra.

Folder DFNsMeshGenerator3D contains the installation, the input data format file and examples. 

The algorithm is the version of the algorithm based on the following article which is ready for accepting by CAGEO:

<A Constrained Delaunay Discretization Method for Adaptively Meshing Highly
Discontinuous Geological Media>
